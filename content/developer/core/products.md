## Overview

Product records track unique products within your store. These differ from <%= link_to "Variants", "#variants" %>, which track the unique variations of a product. For instance, a product that's a T-shirt would have variants denoting its different colors. Together, Products and Variants describe what is for sale.

Products have the following attributes:

* `name`: short name for the product
* `description`: The most elegant, poetic turn of phrase for describing your product's benefits and features to your site visitors
* `permalink`: An SEO slug based on the product name that is placed into the URL for the product
* `available_on`: The first date the product becomes available for sale online in your shop
* `deleted_at`: The date the product is no longer available for sale in the store
* `meta_description`: A description targeted at search engines for search engine optimization (SEO)
* `meta_keywords`: Several words and short phrases separated by commas, also targeted at search engines

To understand how variants come to be, you must first understand option types and option values.

## Option Types and Option Values

Option types denote the different options for a variant. A typical option type would be a size, with that option type's values being something such as "Small", "Medium" and "Large". Another typical option type could be a color, such as "Red", "Green" or "Blue".

A product can be assigned many option types, but must be assigned at least one if you wish to create variants for that product.

## Variants

Variant records track the individual variants of a Product. Variants come in two flavours: master variants and normal variants.

Variant records can track some individual properties regarding a variant, such as height, width, depth, and cost price. These properties are unique to each variant, and so are different from <%= link_to "Product Properties", "products", "product-properties" %>, which apply to all variants of that product.

### Master Variants

Every single product has a master variant, which tracks basic information such as a count on hand, a price and a SKU.

By having a master variant, the code within Spree to track <%= link_to "Line Items", 'orders', 'line_item' %> is simplified.

### Normal Variants

Variants which are not the master variant are unique based on <%= link_to "option type", "#option-type" %> and <%= link_to "option value", "#option-value" %> combinations. For instance, you may be selling a product which is a Baseball Jersey, which comes in the sizes "Small", "Medium" and "Large", as well as in the colors of "Red", "Green" and "Blue". For this combination of sizes and colors, you would be able to create 9 unique variants:

* Small, Red
* Small, Green
* Small, Blue
* Medium, Red
* Medium, Green
* Medium, Blue
* Large, Red
* Large, Green
* Large, Blue

## Images

Images link to a product through its master variant. The sub-variants for the product may also have their own unique images to differentiate them in the frontend.

Spree automatically handles creation and storage of several size versions of each image (via the Paperclip plugin). The default styles are as follows:

```ruby
:styles => {
  :mini => '48x48>',
  :small => '100x100>',
  :product => '240x240>',
  :large => '600x600>'
}```

These sizes can be changed by altering the value of `Spree::Config[:attachment_styles]`. (TODO: information about regenerating existing images)

## Product Properties

Product properties track individual attributes for a product which don't typically apply to products. These are typically additional information about the item. For instance, a T-Shirt may have properties representing information about the kind of material used, as well as the type of fit the shirt is.

Product properties should not be confused with <%= link_to "option values", "products", "option-types-and-option-values" %>, which are used when defining <%= link_to "variants","products", "variants" %> for a product. Properties are for a product, while option values are for variants.

You can retrieve the value for a property on a `Product` object by calling the `property` method on it and passing through that property's name:

```bash
product.property("material")
=> "100% Cotton"```

You can set a property on a product by calling the `set_property` method:

```ruby
product.set_property("material", "100% cotton")```

If this property doesn't already exist, a new `Property` instance with this name will be created.

## Multi-currency support

Price objects track a price for a particular currency and variant combination. For instance, a <%= link_to "variant", "#variants" %> may be available for $15 (15 USD) and €7 (7 Euro).

This presence or lack of a price for a variant in a particular currency will determine if that variant is visible in the frontend. If no variants of a product have a particular price value for the current currency, that product will not be visible in the frontend.

You may see what price a product would be in the current currency (`Spree::Config[:currency]`) by calling the `price` method on that instance:

```bash
product.price
=> "15.99"```

To find a list of currencies that this product is available in, call `prices` to get a list of related `Price` objects:

```bash
product.prices
=> [#<Spree::Price id: 2 ...]```

## Prototypes

A prototype is a useful way to share common option type and property combinations amongst many different products. For instance, if you're creating a lot of shirt products, you may wish to maintain the "Size" and "Color" option types, as well as a "Fitting Type" property.

TODO: Flesh out information about prototypes.

## Taxons and Taxonomies

Taxonomies provide a simple, yet robust way of categorizing products by enabling store administrators to define as many separate structures as needed.

When working with Taxonomies there are two keys terms to understand:

* Taxonomy – a hierarchical list which is made up of individual Taxons. Each taxonomy relates to one Taxon, which is its root node.
* Taxon – a single child node which exists at a given point within a Taxonomy. Each Taxon can contain many (or no) sub / child taxons. Store administrators can define as many Taxonomies as required, and link a product to multiple Taxons from each Taxonomy.

By default, both Taxons and Taxonomies are ordered by their `position` attribute.

Taxons use the [Nested set model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model) for their heirarchy. The `lft` and `rgt` columns in the `spree_taxons` table represent the locations within the heirarchy of the item. This logic is handled by the [awesome_nested_set](https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set) gem.

Taxons link to products through an intermediary model called `Classification`. This model exists so that when a product is deleted, all the links for that product to its taxon are deleted automatically. A similar action takes place when a taxon is deleted: all the links to a product are deleted automatically.

Linking to a taxon in a controller or a template should be done using the `spree.nested_taxons_path` helper, which will use the taxon's permalink to
generate a URL such as `/t/categories/brand`.
